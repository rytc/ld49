# Ludum Dare 49 Jam Game

Un's Table is my entry for Ludum Dare 49, a game about the unscrupulous merchant named Uns. The theme for the Jam is Unstable. The goal is to bring Uns the Unscrupulous Merchant the loot that he desires. Be careful, he is particular about his loot!

## Dependencies
* Raylib

## How to build
Note that sounds and textures are not in the Github repo, and must be downloaded through the release file. 
* Windows: run `build.bat`. Uses msvc 2019 to compile, make sure to run `vcvarsall.bat`. Will need to create the "bin" directory for build output, and add the raylib.dll
